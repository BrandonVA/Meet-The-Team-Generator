## Description 

This project uses a command-line interface to create an HTML page from a series of questions asked using the CLI.  The goal is to generate a page displaying the team of a project. The CLI will prompt you to add information about the team then updates prebuilt templates and creates the entire HTML page for you so the project manager of a team of engineers and students can save time creating a page about the team. 

- Here is a link to the [Project Page](https://github.com/BrandonVA/Meet-The-Team-Generator).
